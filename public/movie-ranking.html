<h1>Best anime to watch for begginers according to me(MannaA)</h1>
 <h2>My top 5 Animes</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Attack on Tiatan</h3>
 <p>It is my first anime. I like it because of the storyline, foreshadowing, and of course for the action element</p>
 <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
 <p>I like it because of the simplicity. You are a human and there are demons, so you must've figured out the stuff already</p>
 <h3>Another</h3>
 <p>One of the best horror anime i have watched, the mystery element is insane, you will be hooked up till the end</p>
 <h3>Maid Sama!</h3>
 <p>One of the best romance anime i have watched, very underrated. Storyline is amazing</p>
 <h3>Oregairu</h3>
 <p>If you are looking for both slice-of-life and romance, then Oregairy is the best choice for you trust me you wont't regret watching it</p>
